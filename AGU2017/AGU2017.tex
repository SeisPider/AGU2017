\begin{posterbox}[column=0, row=0]{1. Introduction}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
As a typical active intracontinental mountain range in Central Asia, Tian
Shan Mt serves as the prototype in studying geodynamic processes and mechanism
of intracontinental mountain building.
We study 3D crust and the uppermost mantle structure beneath Tian Shan and close region
using ambient noise and earthquake surface waves.
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, below=auto]{2. Data and Methods}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
My data set contains 60 brand-band seismic stations mainly
locating at foot of Tian Shan mountain and joint area.
Several stations, situating at the sounthern foot of Altai Mt. and northern foot of Kunlun Mt.,
provide critical ray path coverage of Junggar amd Tarim basins.Our dataset includes vertical
component continuous record from 2015 to 2016 and teleseismic waveforms,
whose magnitudes are over 5.5, focal depths are shallower than 200 km and happened during
2013 and 2016.

 Firstly, we measure group velocity diospersion curve of fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave in the period of 3 to 45 s using
 a frequency-time analysis method from two-year stacked Empirical Green's Function (EGF).
 Secondly, we collect surface wave data from tele-seismic events and measure group velocities of the fundamental-mode
 of Rayleigh wave in the period of 25 to 55 s using a two-station method.
 Finally, we combine the group velocity dispersion curves measured from ambient noise and earthquake surface waves,
 obtain lateral isotropic group velocity maps at different periods based on tomography and invert a 3D Vsv model of crust
 and uppermost mantle down to about 70 km using a Monte Carlo Inversion method.

The PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals exhibits
large spatial variations from -1.0 s to 1.0 s in a horizontal distance of
about $5^\circ$ (Fig. 2).




The PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals have a positive correlation
with PKiKP travel time residuals (Fig. 3a), while no correlation is found with PcP
travel time residuals (Fig. 3b), implying that the large variations of PKiKP-PcP
residuals mainly come from PKiKP phases. A typical ULVZ model of a 10\%
decrease in P wave velocity over a 15 km layer near the PKiKP entrant or
exit points at the CMB, gives a travel time pertubation of about 0.12 s,
which is not quite large enough to account for the observed variation of 1.0 s.
Thus, the observed PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals may indicate
a ICB topographic change of 5 km.

\begin{posterbox}[column=2 ]{4. ICB Beneath the Bearing Sea}
In this section, we present seismic observations which sample the ICB region beneath
Bearing Sea (Fig. 1b). The small variations of the PKiKP-PcP differential
travel time residuals indicate a flat ICB in this region (Fig. 6).


The linear relationship between PKiKP and PcP travel time residuals (Fig. 7)
indicates that most variations in PKiKP and PcP travel time residuals
originate from shallow Earth's hetergeneity, which can be effectively
eliminated by using PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals.

The stacked PKiKP and PcP waveforms show similar waveforms (Fig. 8), indicating a sharp
interface at both the CMB and ICB. The PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios exhibit
large scattering on single records.
The PKiKP/PcP amplitde ratios binned by epicentral distance,
exhibit much larger amplitude ratios than predictions of different ICB models (Fig. 9).

\begin{posterbox}[column=2, below=auto]{5. Conclusions}
We collect a large dataset of high-quality PKiKP waveforms, and use
PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals, PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios,
and PKiKP-PcP waveform differences to constrain ICB properties.
Based on the observations, the ICB beneath Bearing Sea has a sharp and flat
boundary, and the ICB beneath Mexico may have a bumpy ICB with a topographic
height change of 5 km. PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios are much larger than predictions,
implying possible other factors which affects the amplitude ratios.
