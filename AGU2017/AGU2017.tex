\begin{posterbox}[column=0, row=0]{1. Introduction}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
As a typical active intracontinental mountain range in Central Asia, Tian
Shan Mt serves as the prototype in studying geodynamic processes and mechanism
of intracontinental mountain building. In Tian Shan Mt. and nearby area,  There are three mainly geological blocks,
Tarim basin, Tian Shan Mountain and Junggar basin. To figure out underground structure and geological evolution history there,
We study 3D crust and the uppermost mantle structure beneath Tian Shan and close region
using ambient noise and earthquake surface waves.
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, below=auto]{2. Data and Methods}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
My data set contains 60 brand-band seismic stations mainly
locating at foot of Tian Shan mountain and joint area (Fig. 1.).
Several stations, situating at the sounthern foot of Altai Mt. and northern foot of Kunlun Mt.,
provide critical ray path coverage of Junggar amd Tarim basins.Our dataset includes vertical
component continuous record from 2015 to 2016 and teleseismic waveforms,
whose magnitudes are over 5.5, focal depths are shallower than 200 km and happened during
2013 and 2016.

We combine the group velocity dispersion curves measured from ambient noise and earthquake surface waves,
obtain lateral isotropic group velocity maps at different periods based on tomography and invert a 3D Vsv model of crust
and uppermost mantle down to about 70 km using a Monte Carlo Inversion method.

We control quality of dispersion curves with spectral signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and standard deviation of measuremens.
For EGFs, we define signal-noise-ratio (SNR) as ratio of peak in signal window of surface
wave and root mean standard (rms) in noise window at each period and we measure dispersion curves every trimesters
which provides standard deviation of dispersion curve between a pair of station.
We measure dispersion curves from telesemic waveforms of different events of two stations.
These curves give final dispersion curve to be meadian of them and standard deviation at each periods (Fig. 2.).

We take weighted average of reliable dispersion curves measured from EGF and teleseismic waveform to be final
usable dispersion curves (Fig. 3.) and the weight is inverse of their standard deviation.

Limegreen squares give combined dispersion curve. At overlap periods, green squares are weight average of blue and red circles
, in which weights are inverse of their error which summation of their errors gives error of combined dispersion curve.

\begin{posterbox}[column=1]{3. 2D Group velocity Maps}

With combined dispersion curves, we use traditional surface wave tomography method
to image 2D Rayleigh group velocity maps. Resolutions shown by fitted radius is
consistent with that shown by checkerboard test, indicating this inversion can
resolve $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ anomalies (Fig. 3.).

\begin{posterbox}[column=2, below=auto]{5. Conclusions}
We collect a large dataset of high-quality PKiKP waveforms, and use
PKiKP-PcP differential travel time residuals, PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios,
and PKiKP-PcP waveform differences to constrain ICB properties.
Based on the observations, the ICB beneath Bearing Sea has a sharp and flat
boundary, and the ICB beneath Mexico may have a bumpy ICB with a topographic
height change of 5 km. PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios are much larger than predictions,
implying possible other factors which affects the amplitude ratios.
