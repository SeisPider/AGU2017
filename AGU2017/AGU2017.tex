\begin{posterbox}[column=0, row=0]{1. Introduction}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
As a typical active intracontinental mountain range in Central Asia, Tian
Shan Mt. serves as the prototype in studying geodynamic processes and mechanism
of intracontinental mountain building (Fig. 1). Under Tian Shan Mt. and nearby area,
there are three main geological blocks, named as Tarim basin, Tian Shan Mt.
and Junggar basin. To figure out underground structure and geological evolution history there,
we study 3D crust and uppermost mantle structure beneath Tian Shan Mt. and adjoin region
using joint surface wave tomography method based on ambient noise and teleseismic records.
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, below=auto]{2. Data and Method}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
My dataset contains records from 60 brand-band seismic stations, mainly
locating at foot of Tian Shan Mt. and adjoin area (Fig. 1).
Several stations, situating at the sounthern foot of Altai Mt. and northern foot of Kunlun Mt.,
provide critical ray path coverage of Junggar amd Tarim basins. Our dataset includes continuous records
of vertical components from 2015 to 2016 and teleseismic waveforms from 2013 to 2016.
Magnitudes of these earthquakes are over 5.5 and their focal depths are shallower than 200 km.

We combine the group velocity dispersion curves measured from empirical green's functions (EGFs) and teleseismic surface waves,
obtain lateral isotropic Rayleigh group velocity maps at different periods based on traditional surface wave tomography method
and  construct a 3D $V_{sv}$ model down to about 70 km using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC).

named as AKS and KOL, which are collineation with star-labelled earthquake.

We control qualities of dispersion curves with spectral signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and standard deviation of measurements (Fig. 2).
For EGFs, we define signal-noise-ratio (SNR) as ratio of peak in surface wave signal window and root mean standard (rms) in noise window at each period and we measure dispersion curves every trimesters
, which provide standard deviation of dispersion curve between a pair of stations.
We measure dispersion curves from telesemic waveforms of different events with two-station method.
These curves give final dispersion curve with their medians and standard deviations at each periods .

We take averages of reliable dispersion curves, measured from EGFs and teleseismic waveforms to be final
usable dispersion curves (Fig. 3) which are weighted by inverses of their standard deviations. The standard
deviations of final dispersion curves are the summation of those constituents.

Limegreen squares give combined dispersion curve. At overlap periods, green squares are weighted averages of blue and red circles
, in which weights are inverses of their observational error and summation of their errors gives measurement error of combined dispersion curve.

\begin{posterbox}[column=1]{3. 2D Group velocity Maps}

With combined dispersion curves, we use traditional surface wave tomography method
to image 2D Rayleigh group velocity maps.

Resolutions shown by fitted radius are
consistent with those shown in checkerboard tests, indicating we can
resolve $222 \ \textit{km} \times 222 \ \textit{km}$ anomalies at Junggar basin,
middle Tian Shan Mt. and  western Tarim basin. However, at the main part of Tarim basin ,
eastern and western parts of Tian Shan Mt., we can only resolve $555 \ \textit{km} \times 555 \ \textit{km}$
anomalies (Fig. 4).

2D Rayleigh group velocity perturbation maps partly show differences between three main geological
blocks. At short periods (10, 26 and 33 s),  perturbation maps are influenced by sedimentary layer, showing
low group velocities in Junggar and Tarim basins. Long period map shows high velocities there, as they are cratons (Fig. 5).

solid black line encloses area with resolution better than $250$ km.  Limegreen triangles

They show Rayleigh group velocity perturbation maps, refering to $2.69315$ km/s which is estimated average group velocity
of study area at 10 s and the colorbars indicate percent of perturbation.
Synthetic model (c) with $222 \ \textit{km} \times 222 \ \textit{km}$ anomalies for checkerboard test and its recovered model (d).
Increasing scale of anomalies up to $555 \ \textit{km} \times 555 \ \textit{km}$, we obtain synthetic model (e) and
recovered one (f).

\begin{posterbox}[column=2 ]{4. Shear wave velocity models}
We invert 1D shear velocity model at each points with Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method, based on dispersion curves extracted from above 2D group velocity
maps (Goutorbe, 2015).

\begin{posterbox}[column=2, below=auto]{5. Conclusions}
Current model has multiple resolutions at diffferent regions. It has
$222 \ \textit{km} \times 222 \ \textit{km}$, or even better resolution at
Tian Shan Mt. and Junggar basin and around $555 \ \textit{km} \times 555 \ \textit{km}$ resolution
due to sparseness and nonuniform data coverage at the main part of Tarim basin.

However, it does reflect difference between Tarim, Junggar basins and Tian Shan Mt..
The Tarim and Junggar basins correspond to low shear velocity in upper crust due to sedimentation and
Tian Shan Mt. has high velocity. Things take on the opposite side in middle and lower crust due to the
existence of cratons.
